# Numbers and Mathematical Operations
### We can execute mathematical operations in Python. Lets see them now - 
### So we use the same symbols as we use in Maths for addition and subtraction , for multiplication, dividion and remainder we have other symbols so lets see them. Basic examples are there in 

| Operation | Symbol | Code |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Addition | + | `print(5+1)` |
| Subtraction | - | `print(5-1)` |
| Multiplication | * | `print(4*5)` |
| Division | / | `print(20/5)` |
