# Variables
### How would you store a packet of open cookies? 
### Probably put it in a jar isn't it?
### Just like how you store cookies in jar we use **Variables** to store data.
Thus **Variables** == Jar and Data == Cookies.

### So now lets program it :
```python
name = "James" # We are storing the name 'James' in 'name' variable.
age = '28' # We are storing the age '28' in age variable.
print(name, age)
```
