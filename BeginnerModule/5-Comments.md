# Comments
### We use comments to explain the code, so that if someone else wants to edit the code he or she shall understand the code not only for others but so that you may also understand the code if you forget it.

### In Python we use `#` to type a comment. One example is given below ðŸ‘‡

```python
print(4+5) # Here we are adding 4 and 5
```
