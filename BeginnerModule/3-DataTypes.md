# Time for Data types
### If you are a programmer already then you will surely know what are Data Types for newbies Data types are different types of "Data" like numbers, text, and etc. In Python we have the following Datatypes :

## SO now lets see them in code ðŸ‘‡

### String or str is nothing but "Text" it can also have numbers but we cant use them to calculate. 
```python
# String
stre = "Hello Guys"
print(stre)
print(type(stre))
```
### Integers are nothing but numbers or Whole Numbers like 2 , 32 , 344 and etc. 

> Note - "Remeber we dont need quotes like we need in strings"
```python
#Integers
inte = 8747 
print(inte)
print(type(inte)) #To check which type of data type it is
```

### Float it is nothing but decimal numbers like 0.342 or 13.34
> Note - "Even if you provide a whole number it show it in decimal value like 83 as 83.0"
```python
#Float
floate = 8747.43
print(floate)
print(type(floate)) #To check which type of data type it is
```
## ***Other Data Types are coming soon!***
