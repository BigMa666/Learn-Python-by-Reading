# Learn Python by Reading
In this repository I have uploaded all essentials of python. You can just read or view to learn or revise your concepts.

## Beginner Module 
### Lets write our first Python code !
#### To print statements in Python we use *print("")* function.
> So using it lets print Hello World
```
print("Hello World")
```
### Time for Data types
#### If you are a programmer already then you will surely know what are Data Types
#### for newbies Data types are different types of "Data" like numbers , text , and etc. In Python we have the following Datatypes :
```python
Data Types = ['integer or int','float or decimal numbers','boolean or True/False',"string or text",'complex','tuples','dictionary','list']
#AND MORE I THINK hehe
````
[For Better Understanding](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20191023173512/Python-data-structure.jpg)
> SO now lets see them in code ðŸ‘‡
```python
#Integers are nothing but numbers or Whole Numbers like 2 , 32 , 344 and etc. So to make or store it we just use var :
var = 8747 #remeber we dont need quotes like in string 


```
### Operators
#### We ops aka operators in Python. Lets see the mathematical ones first - 
> So we use the same symbols as we use in Maths for addition and subtraction , for multiplication, dividion and remainder we have other
> symbols so lets see them.
```
Add - +
Sub - -
Multiply - *
Division - /
Remainder - %
```
