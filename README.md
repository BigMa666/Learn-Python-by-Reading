# Learn Python by Reading
In this repository I have uploaded all essentials of python. You can just read or view to learn or revise your concepts.

## Beginner Module 
### Lets write our first Python code !
#### To print statements in Python we use *print("")* function.
> So using it lets print Hello World
```
print("Hello World")
```
### Time for Data types
#### If you are a programmer already then you will surely know what are Data Types
#### for newbies Data types are different types of "Data" like numbers , text , and etc. In Python we have the following Datatypes :
```python
Data Types = ['integer or int','float or decimal numbers','boolean or True/False',"string or text",'complex','tuples','dictionary','list']
#AND MORE I THINK hehe
````

> SO now lets see them in code ðŸ‘‡

> Integers are nothing but numbers or Whole Numbers like 2 , 32 , 344 and etc. So to make or store it we just use variables (like below)

> Note - "Remeber we dont need quotes like we need in strings"
```python
#Integers
inte = 8747 
print(inte)
print(type(inte)) #To check which type of data type it is
```

> Float it is nothing but decimal numbers like 0.342 or 13.34
> So to make or store it we just use variables (like below)

> Note - "Even if you provide a whole number it show it in decimal value like 83 as 83.0"
```python
#Float
floate = 8747.43
print(floate)
print(type(floate)) #To check which type of data type it is
```

> String or str is nothing but "Text" it can also have numbers but we cant use them to calculate. So to make or store it we just use variables and write them in quotes (like below)
```python
stre = "Hello Guys "
print(stre)
print(type(stre))
```
## ***I will discuss other data types later in this course untill then these are enough.***

### Numbers and Maths Ops
#### We use Maths in Python. Lets see them now - 

> So we use the same symbols as we use in Maths for addition and subtraction , for multiplication, dividion and remainder we have other
> symbols so lets see them. Basic examples are there in 
beginnermodule python file.

```
Add - +
Sub - -
Multiply - *
Division - /
Remainder - %
```
